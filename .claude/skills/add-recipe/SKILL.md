# Add a new vLLM recipe

Recipes are YAML files at `models/<hf_org>/<hf_repo>.yaml`. The path mirrors HuggingFace (`huggingface.co/<hf_org>/<hf_repo>`), and the site/API are generated at build time from these files + `taxonomy.yaml` + `strategies/*.yaml`.

## End-to-end steps

1. **Confirm the HF id.** You need the exact `<org>/<repo>` string. If the user gave a URL, strip the `https://huggingface.co/` prefix.
2. **Fetch model metadata.** Run `bash scripts/hf-info.sh <org>/<repo>` to pull `config.json` / `params.json`. Extract:
   - `architecture`: `moe` if `num_experts`, `num_local_experts`, `moe.num_experts`, or a `*MoE*` architecture name is present. Otherwise `dense`.
   - `parameter_count`: total params (e.g. `"671B"`, `"70B"`). Use HF model card or the sum of shard sizes.
   - `active_parameters`: for MoE, the activated-per-token count (e.g. `"37B"` on DeepSeek-V3.2). For dense, equal to `parameter_count`.
   - `context_length`: `max_position_embeddings` from `config.json` (for VL models, from `text_config.max_position_embeddings`).
3. **Read the README — don't skip this.** Run `curl -sL "https://huggingface.co/<org>/<repo>/resolve/main/README.md"` and scan the install / serve / usage sections in full. Configs are not enough; model authors put load-bearing requirements in prose. Mine the README for:
   - **`min_vllm_version` / `nightly_required`** — phrases like "install vllm nightly", "requires nightly wheels", or an install snippet using `--extra-index-url https://wheels.vllm.ai/nightly` mean `min_vllm_version: "nightly"` + `nightly_required: true`. A specific tag like "vLLM >= 0.12.0" sets that version. Don't default to `0.11.0` when the README says otherwise.
   - **`dependencies:`** — any pip line beyond `vllm` itself: version pins (`mistral_common >= 1.11.1`, `transformers >= 5.4.0`), extras (`vllm[audio]`), source installs (`pip install git+...`), DeepGEMM pins, etc. Pin them even when the README says "auto-installed" — users on stale wheel caches need an explicit upgrade path. Each entry needs a one-line `note` saying *why*.
   - **Parser flags for `features:`** — `--tool-call-parser <name>`, `--reasoning-parser <name>`, `--enable-auto-tool-choice`. Use the exact parser name the README specifies.
   - **Companion / draft repos** — EAGLE / MTP / Eagle3 heads, NVFP4 quants, instruct vs base. Wire as `spec_decoding` feature (draft pointer in `--speculative-config`) or a sibling variant with `model_id:` override. Copy the recommended `--speculative-config` JSON verbatim from the README.
   - **Recommended serve flags** — `--tensor-parallel-size`, `--gpu-memory-utilization`, `--max-num-batched-tokens`, `--max-num-seqs` go into the guide's launch command and into variant `extra_args` when they're variant-specific.
   - **Hardware guidance / sampling defaults** — "recommended on 8xH200" lines inform variant `description` + `vram_minimum_gb`; recommended `temperature` / `top_p` / `reasoning_effort` go in the guide's Client Usage block.
4. **Cross-check upstream vLLM support.** The README is a snapshot — if it was written at a moment when only nightly worked, that claim rots once stable ships. **Never copy the README's "vLLM nightly" claim verbatim without checking.** Run these in parallel:
   - `gh search issues --repo vllm-project/vllm "<model-name>" --state all --limit 20` — bug reports tell you which versions users are actually running on (e.g. an issue body saying "vLLM 0.18.0 + this model crashes" is positive proof the model loads on 0.18.0).
   - `gh search prs --repo vllm-project/vllm "<model-name>" --merged --limit 10` — locate the support PR; `gh pr view <num> --json mergedAt` gives the date, cross-reference against `gh release list --repo vllm-project/vllm` to find the minimum release.
   - **`curl` the registry and supported-models docs at the candidate tag** — this is the most authoritative check:
     ```bash
     curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vllm-project/vllm/<tag>/vllm/model_executor/models/registry.py" | grep -i "<arch>"
     curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vllm-project/vllm/<tag>/docs/models/supported_models.md" | grep -B2 -A4 "<arch>"
     ```
     `supported_models.md` often documents **required flags that the model card omits** — e.g. Voxtral Realtime needs `--tokenizer-mode mistral` per vLLM docs, but the HF README doesn't mention it. Always read this file for the recipe's target tag.
   - `gh release view <tag> --repo vllm-project/vllm --json body` + grep for the model name — release-note mentions confirm support officially landed.
   - For newer architectures, also search the model author's repo (e.g. `PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR`, `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-VL2`) for "vllm" discussions — authors often post the canonical launch command and known issues there.

   What to extract:
   - **`min_vllm_version`** — set to the **lowest stable tag where the model actually works**, not what the README claims. Walk forward from the support-PR's release tag, but bump up if there are known parser/tokenizer/quant bugs fixed in a later release (the v0.20.0-style "Mistral Grammar factory" / "tool parser HF-tokenizer fix" entries are signals to bump). Only use `min_vllm_version: "nightly"` + `nightly_required: true` when the registry at the latest stable tag genuinely lacks the architecture — and double-check by curling `registry.py` at that tag. If support is still an open issue (no PR merged), flag this to the user before authoring. For derivative releases (e.g. PaddleOCR-VL-1.5 vs 1.0) with identical `architectures` / `model_type` / `auto_map`, the existing handler usually loads them via `--trust-remote-code` even before a dedicated PR — note this assumption in your reply.
   - **Required serve flags hidden in upstream docs** — copy any `must be served with <flag>` lines from `supported_models.md` straight into `model.base_args` (and call them out in the guide's launch command). These are not optional and the README often doesn't mention them.
   - **Troubleshooting** — recurring errors and fixes from issue comments (e.g. "needs `--enforce-eager` on 0.11.x", "transformers>=5 required", "`--mm-processor-cache-gb 0` to avoid OOM"). Surface these in the guide's Troubleshooting section, or as inline tips next to the launch command if they're load-bearing.
   - **Links to put in `guide`'s References** — the model card, vLLM support PR (not the recipe-request issue — see below), and any author-side deployment doc. These give users a path forward if their setup breaks.

   **What NOT to put in References**: the recipe-request issue in `vllm-project/recipes` (e.g. `#459`) is a tracking ticket, not a user-facing reference. It belongs in the PR description body (`Closes #459`), never in the YAML's `## References` section.

5. **Create the YAML.** Write `models/<hf_org>/<hf_repo>.yaml` following the schema below. Only include sections the model needs; leave `features: {}`, `opt_in_features: []`, `hardware_overrides: {}`, `strategy_overrides: {}` empty if not applicable.
6. **Register the provider (if new).** If `<hf_org>` isn't already in `src/lib/providers.js`, add an entry with `display_name` and the logo path `/providers/<hf_org>.png` (or `.jpeg`). Logos get downloaded by `scripts/fetch-provider-logos.mjs` on the next build.
7. **Validate.** Run `node scripts/build-recipes-api.mjs`. It must print `✓ JSON API: N models, 7 strategies` with no errors.
8. **Commit.** Follow the user's earlier feedback (no kill-and-rebuild of dev server; syntax-check only).

## VRAM formula

`vram_minimum_gb = ceil(params × bytes_per_param × 1.2)` where params is the **total** parameter count (MoE includes inactive experts — they still live in VRAM).

| Precision | Bytes/param |
|-----------|-------------|
| bf16, fp16 | 2 |
| fp8, int8, awq, gptq (8-bit) | 1 |
| int4, nvfp4, fp4, mxfp4 (4-bit) | 0.5 |

Example: a 70B BF16 model → `70 × 2 × 1.2 = 168 GB`. Round up.

If the variant is `model_id`-overridden and the override is a different base model with its own param count (e.g. a distilled FP4 checkpoint), use the override's parameter count — verify it via HF.

**Mixed-precision quants (NVFP4 / ModelOpt) — don't trust the bytes-per-param table.** NVIDIA ModelOpt NVFP4 checkpoints are *not* uniformly 4-bit: only the MLP linears drop to NVFP4 (W4A16), while attention linears + KV cache stay FP8 and embeddings/norms stay higher precision. `hf_quant_config.json` shows `quant_algo: MIXED_PRECISION` in this case. The pure `params × 0.5 × 1.2` formula then **underestimates** — e.g. `nvidia/Qwen3.6-27B-NVFP4` is ~21.9 GB on disk, not the 13.5 GB the table implies, so `27B × 0.5 × 1.2 = 17` is wrong (the weights alone exceed it). For any mixed-precision checkpoint, size from the **real weight footprint** instead:

```bash
# total_size is in bytes → GB; then × 1.2 for KV/activation overhead
curl -sL "https://huggingface.co/<org>/<repo>/resolve/main/model.safetensors.index.json" \
  | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(round(json.load(sys.stdin)['metadata']['total_size']/1e9*1.2))"
```

So `vram_minimum_gb = ceil(real_checkpoint_GB × 1.2)` (Qwen3.6-27B-NVFP4 → `ceil(21.9 × 1.2) = 27`). The bytes-per-param table stays correct for *uniform* quants (plain int4/awq/gptq/fp8, and full-model FP4).

## Naming and conventions

- **Feature keys**: prefer `tool_calling`, `reasoning`, `spec_decoding`. Don't use `mtp` — it's been renamed across the repo.
- **Strategy list**: MoE recipes usually support every strategy; dense recipes are limited to `single_node_tp` and `multi_node_tp` (TEP/DEP require MoE).
- **Variants**: quantized variants reuse the base name (`fp8`, `nvfp4`, `int4`). If the quantized checkpoint is authored by someone else (e.g. `nvidia/*-NVFP4`), set `model_id:` inside the variant.
- **Tasks**: `omni` means served via vLLM-Omni (`vllm serve <model> --omni`). Add a top-level `omni:` block listing the task ids the recipe supports — bare strings for catalog defaults (`tasks: [t2i]`) or `{ id, model_id?, vram_minimum_gb?, description?, extra_args? }` overrides when a task swaps the checkpoint (Wan2.2) or needs per-task flags. Audio-only recipes set `omni.serve_binary: "vllm-omni serve"`. The catalog is `src/lib/omni-tasks.js`; do not add `--omni` to `model.base_args` (auto-injected).

## Validation checklist

Before committing:

1. `node scripts/build-recipes-api.mjs` succeeds and the new recipe appears in the line count.
2. `node -e "const d = require('./public/<hf_org>/<hf_repo>.json'); console.log(d.model.parameter_count, d.variants.default.vram_minimum_gb)"` prints sensible values.
3. The YAML top-level key order matches the schema above — downstream tools don't care, but reviewers scan for it.

## Commit

Stage **only** the new recipe (and providers.js if edited):

```bash
git add models/<hf_org>/<hf_repo>.yaml src/lib/providers.js
git commit -m "Add <hf_org>/<hf_repo> recipe"
```

Do not stage `public/` (it's generated) or the design docs.
